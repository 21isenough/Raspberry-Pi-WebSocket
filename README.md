# Raspberry Pi WebSocket
WebSocket enables bidirectional communication in real time over the web.

WebSocket can be run together with a normal HTTP server. You can click a button in a web browser, and enable a GPIO on your Raspberry Pi which turns on a light in your house. All in real time, and with communication going both ways!
